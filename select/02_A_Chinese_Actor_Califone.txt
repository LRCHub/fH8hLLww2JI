Catacomb wine
A Chinese actor loses heart
Just about to flower ready and wet
Root crown sweet ever on
Tricks the light
Legs entwined
Brick on pedal
Chain on wheel
Bones and bread
Tenderness
Here we are
Held and carried
Warm from the machines
Fixing the afterlife
Saints and angels sex lives switch wives
A belly what's never seen the sun
Root crown sweet ever on
Trust came slanted
Made no mention
Bones and bread
Tenderness
A dim head light
Arrives
Friction breathe
Tenderness
Trust came slanted
Legs entwined
Brick on pedal
Chain on wheel
Bones and bread
Tenderness
Here we are
Held and carried
Hot blind fight
Empty armor
Dim head light
Arrives
