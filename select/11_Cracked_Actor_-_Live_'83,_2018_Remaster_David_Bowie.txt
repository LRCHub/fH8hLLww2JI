I've seen all the best of my Hollywood Highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff on my legend
The films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty
'Cause you just got paid

Crack, baby, crack
Oh, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack
Is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck
Come on, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead

You found yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you, baby, you're a porcupine
You sold me illusion for a bag full of checks
You've made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex

Crack, baby, crack
Oh, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack
Is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck
Come on, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead

Oh, stay
Go my way
Hey, hey, hey
