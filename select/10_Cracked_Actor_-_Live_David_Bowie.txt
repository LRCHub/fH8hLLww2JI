I've seen all the rest of my Hollywood highs
The best of the last, neatest star they ever had
I'm stiff from my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty, 'cause you just got paid

Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is all that you'll feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead

You found yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since you pinned your baby you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions, a bag full of checques
You made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex

Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is all that you'll feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead

Stay

Just for a day
